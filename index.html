			Hello!! Welcome to my corner of the internet, This is where i put my writeups for CTF competition that i've participated or just writeups i've done before, this website serve as a benchmark for me to improve myself (as in Feynman Technique) and help other people in learning as well, that is if they decide to read my writeups.
			</p>
			<p>
			If there's some suggestion that you have or you just want to tell me something please email me at <i>pandyherman818@gmail.com</i> .
			</p>
			<p>
			That is all, Enjoy !
